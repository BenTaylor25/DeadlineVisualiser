# Deadline Visualiser

Have you ever felt overwhelmed with how many tasks you have to do?  
Have you ever been so stressed with encroaching deadlines that you're unable to work on anything?

*(The reason behind the second question is a scheduling concept known as 'thrashing').*

When my friends and I are in this situation, I like to make a list of all items that need
to be done, then create a timeline so that I figure out a priority.

Historically, I have done this on paper, but after using 3 sheets of A4 on one schedule,
I realised it would be better-suited to a computed graph.

Deadline Visualiser is a prototype of this digitalisation which I wish to expand in the future.

My next step is typically to backtrack from each of the deadlines (starting with the latest)
to figure out when I should be focusing on everything.
For example, when all but one of your deadlines has passed, you can spend all of your time working
on the last task, whereas earlier tasks need to be balanced out more.
